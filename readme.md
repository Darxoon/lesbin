# lesbin

A modern, simple (WIP) TUI hex editor

## Usage

Run `lesbin <path to binary file>` (or `cargo run -- <path to binary file>`) to open a binary file in lesbin.

All keyboard shortcuts are displayed on screen.

Currently, editing is not yet supported, you can only view files.

## Roadmap

Here are some things i want to implement for this:

* Selecting bytes or text (+ clipboard integration)
* Inserting bytes
* Configuration
* Displaying integer values of byte sequences
* Diffing of files
* Improve performance/memory usage of large files
